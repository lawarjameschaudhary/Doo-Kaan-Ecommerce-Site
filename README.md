## ⚙️ Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend

# 1. Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Apply database migrations
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

# 4. Seed sample data (10 categories, 30 products, 15 users, 20 orders)
python manage.py seed_data

# 5. (Optional) Create a Django superuser for /django-admin/
python manage.py createsuperuser

# 6. Run the development server
python manage.py runserver
```

The API will be available at **http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/**
Django admin (optional, separate from the app's own Admin Panel): **http://127.0.0.1:8000/django-admin/**

### Seeded demo users
All seeded customers use the password `password123` (emails follow the pattern `firstname.lastname{n}@example.com`,
visible via `/django-admin/` or the admin panel's Customers page).

---

## 💻 Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend

# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env if your backend runs on a different host/port

# 3. Run the development server
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at **http://localhost:5173/**

### Environment Variables (`frontend/.env`)
```
VITE_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000/api
```

### Build for production
```bash
npm run build
```
Output is generated in `frontend/dist/`.

---

## 🔑 Admin Panel Access

The Admin Panel is a completely separate interface from the customer storefront.

- URL: **http://localhost:5173/admin/login**
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`

> These credentials are intentionally hardcoded per the project specification (no real authentication
> backend is required for the admin panel — it simply sets a local flag after a successful check against
> the `/api/admin/login/` endpoint).

From the Admin Dashboard you can manage:
- **Products** — add, edit, delete, search, and set flags (featured/trending/flash sale/best seller)
- **Categories** — full CRUD
- **Orders** — view details, update status (Pending → Processing → Delivered / Cancelled), delete
- **Customers** — view and search registered users, delete accounts
- **Messages** — view messages submitted through the Contact page
- **Analytics** — order status breakdown & products-per-category charts
- **Settings** — store info & theme toggle (demo only)

- Cart & Wishlist powered by React Context API, backed by real REST endpoints
- Checkout flow with billing form and 4 payment method options (COD, eSewa, Khalti, Card)
- Customer authentication (signup/login) with frontend validation, stored via token + localStorage
- Separate hardcoded Admin Panel with sidebar navigation, dashboard charts (Recharts), and full CRUD
  for products, categories, and orders, plus customer and message management

- Recently viewed products tracking (localStorage), scroll-to-top button, toast notifications

---

## 🧪 Sample / Seeded Data

Running `python manage.py seed_data` generates:
- 10 categories (Electronics, Fashion, Shoes, Watches, Mobiles, Laptops, Grocery, Beauty, Home Appliances, Books)
- 30 products with realistic prices, discounts, stock levels, and specifications
- 15 customer users (password: `password123`)
- ~20–45 product reviews
- 20 orders across all order statuses

The command is idempotent for categories/products/users (uses `get_or_create`), so it's safe to re-run.

---

## 📌 Notes for Presentation / Viva

- The backend and frontend are fully decoupled — they only communicate through the documented REST API.
- No payment gateway is integrated; checkout simply records the chosen payment method and shows an
  "Order Placed Successfully" confirmation, as specified in the project brief.
- The Admin Panel login is intentionally hardcoded (`admin` / `admin123`) rather than tied to a real
  user account, per the project requirements — it's a separate, simple gate in front of `/admin/*` routes.
- The chatbot is fully rule-based (keyword matching) — no external AI API calls are made.
